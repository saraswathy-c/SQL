### ðŸ“Œ	Session 1 - SQL A-Z Bootcamp (June 2025): <br>

âœ¨	The session introduced us to Databases, DBMS and SQL. <br>
âœ¨	Covered the basic types of different SQL commands: DDL, DML, DCL, TCL and DQL. Also discussed about constraints and data types. <br>
âœ¨	The session introduced us to **Snowflake** - primarily a cloud-based data warehouse. <br>
#### About Snowflake: <br>
Just need a web-based user interface, from which all aspects of managing and using Snowflake can be accessed.  <br>
Snowflake runs completely on cloud infrastructure. <br>
Snowflake is a true self-managed service.  <br> <br>
âœ¨  During the session, we learnt how to create Snowflake objects, load CSV data files, write and execute sample queries.<br>
âœ¨	Studied the **UPI Transactions** dataset and solved the sample queries.<br>
This dataset simulates realistic Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions across various merchant categories in India. It is designed to reflect real-world digital payment patterns, including temporal, demographic, and behavioural features relevant for fraud detection, consumer analytics, and business intelligence. <br>
####  Problem Statement: <br>
1.Display 5 sample transactions.<br>
2. Display the first 20 transactions.<br>
3.Fetch the transactions worth less than 100 INR. Display only the amount and merchant category.<br>
4.How many transactions have happened in total?<br>
5.How many transactions have happened in Karnataka?<br>
6.How many transactions happened in July?<br>
7.What is the average value of all transactions?<br>
8.Display the names of all the banks that initiated the transaction.<br>
9.How many unique types of transactions have been used? <br>
10.Identify all the fraudulent transactions on weekends after midnight and before sunrise. Assume sunrise is at 6 a.m.<br>
11.Identify successful transactions initiated by senior citizens. Assume a senior citizen's age starts at 55.<br>
12.How many failed grocery or shopping transactions have happened between midnight and sunrise on weekdays? Assume sunrise is at 5 a.m.<br>
13.Identify all transactions involving recharge or bill payments at the SBI bank.<br>
